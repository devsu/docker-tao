# docker-tao
Docker images for building and running [TAO Assessment Platform](https://www.taotesting.com/)

## Usage

The easiest way to run tao is using docker-compose. 

1. Clone this repo (or just copy the files in the `example` folder).
2. Modify the `tao/docker-compose.yml` and `tao/nginx` according to your needs.
3. Then just run `docker-compose up` from the `example` folder.

Then just head to http://localhost to start installation.

At installation make sure that you choose the following folder to store data: `/var/lib/tao/data`. As you can see in `Dockerfile`, a volume has been defined for this folder. 

Since this folder is created only in the `tao` image, it won't be accessible by the `web` container, which is good for security reasons.

## Approach

The `tao` image is built using [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).

- The **builder** image downloads the code and install all required packages
- The **runner** image copies the code generated by the builder and installs the runtime dependencies.

The runner is a `php-fpm` image, and thus it requires a **nginx** instance in front of it to serve the application.

The `example/docker-compose.yml` shows how to use it. It defines 2 services:

- **tao**: The container that will run the application.
- **web**: An nginx web server.

Both images share a named volume, which contain the application code.

All images are built in top of Linux alpine, to avoid issues of different ids for the `www-data` user. 

## Building TAO

As you can see in the Dockerfile, TAO is built from the source code releases at https://github.com/oat-sa/package-tao/releases.

It's published in docker-hub at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/devsu/tao, but if you want, you can build it yourself. 

```
docker build --target builder -t tao --env-file .env
```

TAO platform is installed automatically using .env file where we store the next installation params:

FILE_PATH: Path to where asset files should be stored.
DB_DRIVER: Driver engine to connect TAO platform with a database.
DB_HOST: Database location.
DB_NAME: Name of the database used to store data from TAO platform.
DB_USER: Login to access to database.
DB_PASSWORD: Password to access to database.
URL: The URL to access to platform from web browser.
USER: The login of the administrator to be created.
PASSWORD: The password of the administrator.  

These parameters could be changed according with the configuration to be used.


TAO platform is configured to use the latest tao version at moment, but you can easily change the version by passing the `TAO_VERSION` argument.

```
docker build --target builder -t tao --build-arg TAO_VERSION=3.3-rc02 --env-file .env
```

The version must match the version used in the name of the source code zip file.

## Development

If you want to test the docker files as you change them, you need to use the `docker-compose-dev.yml` file instead. 

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-file-dev.yml up --build 
```
